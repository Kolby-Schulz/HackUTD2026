Summary: Live project state as of 87debe9 (2026-11-08). MVP has landed; remaining work is submission, hosting, polish and stretch.

# Status

## Done (see [[history]])
- MVP, two-laptop shared Maincloud DB, any-agent join, replay, benchmark, Nemotron coordinator (#43). 24 PRs merged.

## Open work (GitHub, Kolby-Schulz/HackUTD2026)
- PR #44: coordinator reuses its first ruling for mirror/repeat duplicates
- #26: submission package (README, diagram, demo video, Devpost)
- #17: dashboard polish for judges
- #20: host Contract (public dashboard, always-on services)
- #21: Nemotron for workers + NVIDIA comparison (coordinator half done)
- #35: per-role provider and model choice
- #23: Jev triage (stretch, TRIAGE=off by default)

## Known risks (details in [[Pitfalls]])
- Several server reducers lack identity checks; `reset_demo_state` has no auth.
- Docs disagree on a few points (Node version, NVIDIA key at setup, run-demo status). See [[overview]].
- No tests were run while building this vault (no `node_modules` in this checkout).

## Next action
- Owners: skim your Area note, correct anything wrong, bump `verified:`.
